The following array is given:

int numbers[] = {10,20,30};

Pass the beginning and the end of the array as pointers to a function.
Increase each value by 1 until the end is reached.
Then output the new values (11,21,31) in a function. 
The output is again based on the beginning and the end of the array.

Tip: Arrays are passed as pointers as follows: 

myFunction(numbers+2);
