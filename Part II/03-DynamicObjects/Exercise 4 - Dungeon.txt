A player is to fight a total of 3 monsters to find a treasure.

Create a class "Creature" that has the data members "healthPoints" and "damage".
Create a subclass "Player" that additionally has the data member "potionOfLife".

The player has 100 life points at the beginning and one potion to use.

A menu is to appear which always displays the player's current healthPoints.
The following options are available:

- Attack
	A new monster (creature) appears whose number of healthPoints is random (between 30 and 50).
	--> Always create a new object of the type "Creature" and assign it to the dynamic object.	
	The player's and the monster's healthPoints are displayed.
	The attack damage is determined by a random number (between 10 and 20).
	The player attacks the monster first.
	If the monster has less than 1 healthPoints, the message that it has died appears.
	If the monster is not dead, the monster will then attack the player.	
	If the player has less than 1 healthPoints, the message that he has died appears and how many creatures he has defeated already.

- Drink Potion of Life
	The number of the player's healthPoints increase (randomly between 20 and 30)
	The potionOfLife can only be used once.

- Flee
	The player runs away [program exits]. The number of defeated creatures is displayed.

If the player has defeated 3 creatures, the message appears that he has found the treasure [program exits].
If no potionOfLife has been used, the message appears that the player is a "true hero".

Hint:

Include the library <ctime>.
A random number is created as follows:

srand(time(NULL)); // Random number re-initialized based on time, so that not always the same values occur
int randomNumber = rand() % (maxNumber - minNumber) + minNumber; // Example: maxNumber = 20, minNumber = 10 --> Random number between 20 and 10
