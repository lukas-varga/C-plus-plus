Create a class "Rectangle", which has a length and width as data members.
Create a suitable constructor that fills the data members with data.

A dynamic object is to be created in the main function.
Create a new object until either the length or width is zero.
For each newly created object, the constructor is to be called and the area calculated and displayed on the screen.

Finally, release the memory of the object.
