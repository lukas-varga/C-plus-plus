Create a class "Film", which contains the data members Title, Year and Genre.
In addition, the data member "Successor" is to exist, which points to the next film object in the list.
Create a corresponding constructor that fills the three data members with values.

Also create a class "FilmList", which contains the data members "Beginning" and "End". Both data members are of the type "Film".

Create a concatenated list using the following methods in the class "Filmlist":

-add
	Adds a movie to the end of the list
-clearList
	Deletes the complete list (use delete to remove each item from the memory)
-displayElements
	Outputs the films in the list (title, year, genre)

In the main program 3 film objects are to be added to the list. Then output the list and delete it.
Finally, the FilmList is to be deleted by a destructor.
