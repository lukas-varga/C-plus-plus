Create a class "Element", which (as public) contains the following data members an integer variable called "Value" and a pointer called "Next", which is of the same data type as the class.

Create an object in the main that has the value NULL at the beginning.
Enter a value until 0 is entered. This is to indicate the end of the list.
A new element is to be created for each entered value. The value entered is stored in the variable "value".
Concatenate these elements by setting the "start" object and the "next" object correctly.


Then output the list of values for the created objects.

Hint:

When a new element is inserted, its successor becomes the beginning of the list.
The new element then marks the new beginning of the list.
