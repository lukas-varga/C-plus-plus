Write a program where the user can enter a dividend and a divisor, until the he/she enters (Yes/No) that he/she no longer wants to perform a calculation.

The division is to be carried out at each loop pass. If the divisor is 0, an error message occurs.

In addition, each (valid) result should be saved to a file, including the calculation.

Example content of the file:

10/5=2
40/10=4

When the program is restarted, the new calculations are added to the end of the file.

If the file is write-protected, an error message is thrown.

When exiting the program, the contents of the file should be displayed again.
