A person file contains the four following datasets:


Persno 	Name 	Hours	HourlyWage 
100 	Meier 	152 	9.20 
102 	Kunze 	165 	11.05 
108 	Weber 	190 	15.50 
111 	Berger 	80 	14.20 
 
Define a appropriate class and save these four data sets in an array.

The data records are then to be displayed formatted, whereby in the 5th column the 
GrossWage (Hours * HourlyWage) is to be displayed.
