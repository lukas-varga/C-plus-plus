Realize the calculation of the areas of a rectangle and a triangle by a base class called "polygon". The class contains a virtual function called "area" which returns 0. The two derived classes are to return their areas by using this function.Rectangle: length*widthTriangle: length* width/2Create an instance of each class in the main program.Then each instance is to reference a polygon object (pointer).Set the length and width by using the respective pointers and output their areas.Additional task: Transform your virtual function into a purely virtual function.Then change the main function so that it can be compiled.(The area of polygon is not output)
