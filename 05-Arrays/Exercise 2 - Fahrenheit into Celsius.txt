Use your program from „Exercise 2 - Fahrenheit into Celsius“ from Chapter 4 and modify it as follows:

You want to store the celsius values in an array.

Create an array that can hold 10 Celsius values.
The entered Fahrenheit value is increased in increments of 10.

Use a for loop to do this.

Use a while loop to output the calculated Celsius values with the corresponding Fahrenheit values and the index.
