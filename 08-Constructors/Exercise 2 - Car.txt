Create a class named Car that has the following properties and member functions:


Properties:

-	brand
-	mileage

Member function:

-	drive() -> Has an integer as parameter, which increases the mileage.


To initialize the instances, use a constructor with a member initialization list that takes the two data members.

In addition, you want to declare a class variable that remembers how often you have been driving.

There will be three car rides. The data should be output after each ride.

Finally, a destructor is to be created, that is called at the end of the program and displays,
that the object has been removed.
