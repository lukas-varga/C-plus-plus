The following program is to be created:

-	Displaying a welcome screen
-	Prompt and entering a decimal number
-	Squaring the decimal number (in a function, return is the result 
	[square = number * number]) and output of the result in the main function
-	Prompt and entering a radius
-	Calculation of the circular area (in one function, no return value).
	The result of the calculation [area = radius * radius * constant_pi]) 
	is to be output in this function.
	The variable constant_pi should be declared as a constant and initialized
	with the value 3.14.
	Use the previously created function for the calculation [radius * radius].
