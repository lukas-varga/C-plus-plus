Given is the following program: 

#include <iostream> 
#include <cstdlib>

using namespace std;

class Animal 
{
public: 
	float Number; 
	float Weight;

	void displaydata()
	{ 
		cout <<"There are "<<Number << " animals with " <<Weight <<" kg each availableÒ<<endl; 
	} 
}; 

int main()
{ 
	Animal Pig; 
	Pig.Number=50; 
	Pig.Weight=20; 
	Pig.displaydata(); 

	system("PAUSE");
	return 0; 
}; 


Modify the program as follows:

There should be 3 classes in the program:

- The base class Animals (here only the number of animals is to be administered) 
- The subclass SlaughterCattle (with the data member weight)
- The subclass DairyCattle (with the data member milkyield)

Use a constructor with a member initialization list that attaches values to the data members.
Create an instance of the class SlaughterCattle and DairyCattle and display the data on the screen.
