Create a class Vehicle with the following data members


-	brand


Create the derived classes Car and Truck. Both of them inherit the data members of Vehicle.

Class Car has the following properties:

Data member:
-	Number_Passengers

Constructor:
-	Default constructor -> Records the data of the base/derived class

Member function:
-	Display() -> Outputs all the data
-	Boarding() -> Increases the number of passengers

Class Truck has the following properties:

Data member:
-	Tonnes

Constructor:
-	Default constructor -> Records the data of the base/derived class

Member function:
-	Display() -> Outputs all the data
-	Loading() -> Increases the weight


Create two arrays in the main program.
The first array can hold 3 cars, the second array can hold 2 trucks.
Create 3 instances of each of the two arrays. 
Then call the functions boarding and loading of all instances, whereby the input of the required data is queried in the main function.
Finally, output all data again.
