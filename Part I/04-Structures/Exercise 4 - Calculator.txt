Use the switch-case statement to program a mini calculator that reads two numbers and an operator (+, -, *, /) and outputs the result.

The input should be made directly in one line, e. g. 5+4

Tip: You can use several variables with cin, e. g. cin >> var1 <<< var2;

Any division by 0 is to be intercepted.

If an incorrect operator is entered, an error message should appear.
