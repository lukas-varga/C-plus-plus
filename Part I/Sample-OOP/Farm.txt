Create an array with 100 objects of the type animal in the main program. 
Use a switch-case to create a user menu with the following four options:

-	1: Enter animal ()
-	3: Show animal ()
-	2: Sell animal ()
-	0: Exit program

The menu should reappear until the user enters the number to "Exit program" (while-loop).


The animal number is a consecutive number, which increases if the user has entered an animal.

When entering an animal, the following data should be saved:
-	AnimalNumber
-	Species
-	Weight

All the animals should be displayed with the following data:
-	AnimalNumber
-	Species
-	Weight
-	If the animal is still in stock.

When selling an animal, it should be checked whether the animal is still in the stock and whether the animal number stored corresponds to the animal number entered.

If not, a message should appear stating that the animal number is incorrect or that the animal is not in the stock. The following should be possible
-	Entering the daily price
-	Total revenues should be increased (Weight * DailyPrice)
-	Output the total revenues (here the total revenue of all sold animals is displayed)
-	A sold animal is no longer in stock.
