Create a shopping list for a maximum of 10 products. 
For this purpose, the product name and price should be entered and then saved in an array.
Create a menu with the following functions:

-	New item
-	Show items
-	Sort items
-	Exit

It should also be possible to output the current number of items in the menu.
Sorting is based on the price (the name should be sorted accordingly)
