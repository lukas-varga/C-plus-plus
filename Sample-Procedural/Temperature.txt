During the year, you have recorded the average temperature of the individual months. You now want to write a program that helps you to output this data. Write a program that outputs a menu. The following options should be available:-	When you are entering a month, the corresponding average temperature should be displayed.	o The input should be possible as text input (e. g. “August”)	o and as a selection (e. g. selection: 8 → temperature of August) -	Calculate the average temperature of all months.-	The hottest month of the year is to be output.-	All months should be output in an ascending order with their temperatures.-	If you enter 0, a goodbye message should appear and the program terminates.-	In case the user selection in the menu is non-existent, a message is to be output.You can use fictitious figures for the temperatures of the individual months.
