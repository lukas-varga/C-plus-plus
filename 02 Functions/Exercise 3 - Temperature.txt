We are planning a trip to America. The units for temperature, distance and currency in America are different from the units used in Germany. 
In order to facilitate our planning, we want to write a program that converts the temperature from Fahrenheit to Celsius.
The conversion formula is as follows: Celsius = ((temperature_fahrenheit -  32)*5)/9 

The following requirements have to be met:

1.	Welcome the user, input of temperature in Fahrenheit
2.	Output of the entered temperature in Fahrenheit
3.	Conversion from Fahrenheit to Celsius. The 32 in the formula is to be declared as a constant, this constant should also be used for the conversion. 
	5/9 should remain in the formula.
4.	Output of the temperature in Celsius
