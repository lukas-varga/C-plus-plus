Farmer Max wants to sell a pig. 
Add the following variables to your program from Chapter 1 "Exercise 1 - Farm": 

¥ weight
¥ dailyPrice
¥ revenue

The variable weight (integer) should be used to store the weight of the pig.
The variable dailyPrice (decimal number) should be used to store the daily price of the pig.
Both variables are to be entered in a dialog with the user via the console. 
The revenue is then calculated from weight * daily price. 
Print the revenue on the screen.
