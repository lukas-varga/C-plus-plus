Dear course participants, 

along with the course, I would like to work with you on 
a small program every week. 
In this way, you can practice the content you have learned right away. 
At the end of the week I will submit my solution to the exercise online. 

Here is the first exercise:

Farmer Max has a farm with ducks and pigs. He wants to sell them. 

Write a C++ program that welcomes the user to the farm.

Regards,
Monika Eberle
