//
// 1.1 Declare a class Candle with the following data members:
// Height (in cm) and color. Choose appropriate data types. Only derived classes can change these data members.
// Define for the class:
// a) Default constructor
// b) Parameterized constructor with member initialization list
// c) Member function "data_output" for outputting all data of the class. The member function "data_output" should be defined outside of the class.
//
// 1.2 Definition of member functions:
// You know from experience that a candle loses an average of 3 cm in "height" every hour.
// Define a member function "updateHeight" with a parameter "burning_hours" and a suitable data type for it.
// The task of the member function is to update the "height" of the candle based on the hours.
// If the candle has burned down after the update, the user should get a corresponding message, 
// otherwise the user gets as the output the current height of the candle.
//
// 1.3 Dynamic instantiation:
// Define two dynamic objects of the class Candle. Since the values of the data members do not have to be queried (=not typed in by the user), 
// they can be passed as static members. 
// Call the member function "data_output" for the second instance and the member function "updateHeight" for the first instance.
