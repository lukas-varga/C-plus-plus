Program the game „Guessing Numbers“: The computer generates a random number
between 1 and 100 which the player has to guess. At each pass, the system tells you whether the number entered was too large or too small


Tip: Random numbers are generated as follows: 
A single call of srand(time(NULL)) initializes the random number generator. 
Subsequently, each call of rand()%100 returns a random number between 0 and 99.
The functions are declared in <ctime> and <cstdlib>.
